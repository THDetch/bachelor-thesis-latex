ABSTRACT = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been extensively applied in remote sensing applications. Nevertheless, it is a challenge to process and interpret SAR images. The key to interpreting SAR images lies in transforming them into other forms of remote sensing images to extract valuable hidden remote sensing information. Currently, the conversion of SAR images to optical images produces low-quality results and incomplete spectral information. To address these problems, an end-to-end network model, S2MS-GAN, is proposed for converting SAR images into multispectral images. In this process, to tackle the issues of noise and image generation quality, a TV-BM3D module is introduced into the generator model. Through TV regularization, block-matching, and 3D filtering, these two modules can preserve the edges and reduce the speckle noise in SAR images. In addition, spectral attention is added to improve the spectral features of the generated MS images. Furthermore, we construct a very high-resolution SAR-to-MS image dataset, S2MS-HR, with a spatial resolution of 0.3 m, which is currently the most comprehensive dataset available for high-resolution SAR-to-MS image interpretation. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on the relevant dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in translation performance. The solution effectively facilitates high-quality transitions of SAR images across different types.},

abstract = {Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012–2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived ‘higher-level’ Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements.}

abstract = {The objective of this article is to review the state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies, including platforms and sensors, the topics representing the primary research interest in the ISPRS Technical Commission I activities. Due to ever advancing technologies, the remote sensing field is experiencing unprecedented developments recently, fueled by sensor advancements and continuously increasing information infrastructure. The scope and performance potential of sensors in terms of spatial, spectral and temporal sensing abilities have expanded far beyond the traditional boundaries of remote sensing, resulting in significantly better observation capabilities. First, platform developments are reviewed with the main focus on emerging new remote sensing satellite constellations and UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) platforms. Next, sensor georeferencing and supporting navigation infrastructure, an enabling technology for remote sensing, are discussed. Finally, we group sensors based on their spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics, and classify them by their platform deployment competencies. In addition, we identify current trends, including the convergence between the remote sensing and navigation field, and the emergence of cooperative sensing, and the potential of crowdsensing.}
